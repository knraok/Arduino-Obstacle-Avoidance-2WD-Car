# Arduino-Obstacle-Avoidance-2WD-Car
An Arduino-based 2WD Obstacle Avoidance Car is a popular project in robotics and STEM education. It uses an Arduino board to control a two-wheel-drive chassis, enabling the car to autonomously detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor and basic decision logic.
